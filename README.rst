Introduction
============
**Fos** is a Python framework that makes it easier to develop neural network models 
in PyTorch. Some of the main features are:

* Less boilerplate code required, see also the example below.
* Lightweight and no magic under the hood that might get in the way.
* You can extend Fos using common OO patterns.
* Get the insights you need when you get stuck.


Installation
============
You can install Fos using pip::

    pip install fos
    
Or alternatively from the source::

    python setup.py install
    
Fos requires Python 3.5 or higher.


Usage
=====
Training a model, requires just a few steps. First create the model, optimizer and 
loss function that you want to use using plain PyTorch objects::

   predictor = resnet18()
   optim     = Adam(predictor.parameters())
   loss      = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits

Then create the Fos classes that will take care of the training and output::

   model   = SuperModel(predictor, loss)
   meter   = NotebookMeter()
   trainer = Trainer(model, optim, meter)

And we are ready to start the training::

   trainer.run(train_data, valid_data, epochs=5)


Examples
========
You can find several example Jupyter notebooks `here <https://github.com/innerlogic/fos/examples>`_, 
or even more convenient try them directly in a Google Colab environment:

    1) Basic Example
    2) MNIST example
