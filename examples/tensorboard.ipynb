    "## Introduction\n",
    "This sample notebook shows how to log metrics to TensorBoard. For those not familiar with TensorBoard, it is a visualization tool originally developed for TensorFlow but now also very usable for other frameworks like PyTorch. Under the hood, the logger uses the SummaryWriter to write data to disk. This is done by passing a writer object as an argument to the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest this notebook uses the same dummy data and `resnet18` model as the basic_fos example.\n",

    "\n",
    "After the predictor is instantiated, the optimizer and loss function are created. If you are familiar with PyTorch this should all be straight forward. We choose Adam as the optimizer since it performs well in many scenarios. But feel free to swap it out for any other optimizer. And as a loss function we choose the `binary cross entropy` as that fits the multi-class classification problem well.\n",
