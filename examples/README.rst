Example Notebooks
=================

One way to get famliar with Fos is to play around with some code. For that reason
the following examples in the form of Jupyter Notebooks are provided:

Basic
-----
The basic notebook shows what the minimum steps are required to train a model using
Fos. This provides a good introduction into some of the the core concepts of Fos. 

MNIST
-----
A convolutional network is trained on the MNIST (handwritten digits) dataset. 

Tensorboard
-----------
The change of gradients and weights of the model during training are visualized in 
Tensorboard. A useful technique to detect problems like vanishing gradient.

Transfer Learning
-----------------
Demonstrates how to use transerfer learning to train a network. This includes
features like freezing layers.

Visualization
-------------
Shows how to visualize some of the metrics that are captured during training. 

Inputs
------
Explains how to use models with multiple input and/or outputs.


Google Colab
============

You can run the above notebook on your own computer once you installed Fos. They should
run fine, even if you don't have a GPU.

But it is also possible to run them on Google Colab (Colaboratorium) wihtout 
having to install anything. These are the links to the Google Colab notebooks:
